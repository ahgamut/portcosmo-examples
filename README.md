# examples for compiling `-fportcosmo`

This repository contains some example C source files showing how my [gcc patch
for `-fportcosmo`][patch] works. Originally these examples were part of my [GCC
plugin][plugin], but I moved all the code into the gcc source tree to
simplify it, and kept these examples around to confirm the compiler worked
as expected.
